# Mind Control Program

Welcome to the Mind Control Program GitHub repository! This program is designed to help users achieve their goals, improve their routines, and lead a more fulfilling life. The program incorporates user input through a structured form-based approach, powered by the OpenAI GPT-3 language model.

## Overview

The Mind Control Program is a virtual assistant that guides users through the process of self-improvement. Users fill out premade forms that cover various aspects of their lives, such as their background, goals, daily reflections, and more. The program processes and structures the user input, interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3 model, and populates the information into different tabs, providing users with a personalized experience.

## Features

- Initial Intake Form: Users provide personal information and background.
- Daily Check-In Form: Users reflect on their day, goals, and tasks completed.
- Reflection Questions: Users answer thought-provoking questions to gain insights.
- Chatbot Interaction: Users interact with the chatbot to populate different tabs.
- Tab Navigation: Users navigate between tabs to access functionalities.
- Structured Data Output: GPT-3 generates structured data with flag identifiers.
- Self-Improvement Journey: Users track progress, set goals, and access resources.
